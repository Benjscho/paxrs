# paxrs

## What is this?

It's yet another Paxos implementation, this time in Rust! Specifically this
is an implementation done as an exercise to understand the algorithm, and to 
demonstrate testing distributed systems software using turmoil.

## What is this not?

It's not aiming to be production grade or ready software.
